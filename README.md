## Technologies Used
### React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

-- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
-- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

And;
- **React19**
- **Vite**
- **TailwindCSS** (via PostCSS)
- **React Router**
- **React Toastify**
- **React Icons**

## Key Functionalities
- **CRUD Operations:**
  - Create, Read, Update, and Delete jobs in the job management system.
- **React Hooks:**
  - Used `useState` for state management and `useEffect` for lifecycle methods.
- **React Navigation:**
